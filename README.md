#Optimization for CS
This repository contains Python code for various optimization algorithms implemented as part of the Optimization for CS course. Each lab assignment is contained in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

##List of Lab Assignments:
Lab2-LPP.ipynb: Implementation of Linear Programming Problems.
Lab4-Hessian.ipynb: Implementation of Hessian Matrix calculation.
Lab5-HealthClinic.ipynb: Implementation related to health clinic optimization.
Lab6-Lagrangian.ipynb: Implementation of Lagrangian equations.
Lab7-Peak_load_pricing.ipynb: Implementation of peak load pricing optimization.
Lab8-Golden_Section.ipynb: Implementation of the Golden Section method.
Lab9-Fibonacci_Series.ipynb: Implementation related to the Fibonacci series.
Lab10-Steepest_Desscent.ipynb: Implementation of the Steepest Descent method.
Lab11-Newton.ipynb: Implementation of the Newton method.
Lab12-Conjugate_Descent.ipynb: Implementation of the Conjugate Descent method.

##Usage:
Each notebook contains the Python code along with explanations and examples. You can run these notebooks in a Jupyter environment to see the results and understand the implementations.

Feel free to explore and use these implementations for your learning and projects!
